      <P><B><I><FONT color=#0000ff>Nowadays we're confronted with radio waves 
      all the time.Many of us use mobile phones without ever thinking about the 
      complex processes and high technology making this possible. We do not need 
      to. Nobody will get hurt when the link is temporarily 
      broken.</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P>Not so in model flying.We often move large models at high speed in 
      close proximity of human beings.If we want to minimize the possibility of 
      an accident, we need to <FONT color=#ff0000>understand</FONT> the way our 
      commands are transferred to the model and then <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>optimize </FONT>this for our specific application.The whole 
      command sequence, from the pilot's hand to the control surface in the 
      model , is made up out of different parts that we are able to control 
      perfectly these days: scanning of the stick position in the transmitter, 
      mixing with other commands, generating and broadcasting of the radio 
      signal, and at the end of the chain the moving of the control surface by 
      means of the servo.</P>
      <H3><A name=Anker143602></A>From transmitter to receiver</H3>
      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>Unfortunately, the path between the transmitter and 
      the receiver is disturbed by many influences. </FONT>Among these are 
      internal influences like sparking in the electric motor, bad antenna 
      routing, or outside influences like general High Frequency pollution of 
      our environment by permanent but unknown sources, television and radio 
      broadcasting or mobile communication.I do not wish to talk about somebody 
      using the same frequency.</P>
      <P>On the other hand we have the controlling task, quite different for a 
      slow rudder-elevator glider, perfectly capable to float around by itself 
      for a while, compared to an agile helicopter, crashing instantly (because 
      of its inherent instability) when control is temporarely lost. <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>The frame rate of the RC commands is, due to the safety 
      requirements, directly related to the accuracy of the servo movement 
      following commands, still acceptable connection losses and the possibility 
      to report glitches to the pilot, so he can land early while this is still 
      possible.</FONT></P>

      <P>Usually,as opposed to PCM, PPM equipment is referred to as FM. This 
      could lead to the belief that PCM is not FM. <FONT color=#ff0000>This is 
      wrong!</FONT> PPM and PCM use the same <FONT 
      color=#0000ff>F</FONT>requency <FONT color=#0000ff>M</FONT>odulation 
      (<FONT color=#0000ff>FM</FONT>) of the 35 Mhz-HF-carrier (in this 
      example). The channels have a 10kHz spacing, e.g. channel 68 with a 
      nominal frequency f = 35,080 MHz uses a band from 35,076-35,084. Channel 
      69 again from 35,086-35,094. Between channels there is a 2 kHz <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>Buffer</FONT>. The transmitter in this case is a binary 
      (2-state) <FONT color=#ff0000>FSK-transmitter</FONT> (<FONT 
      color=#0000ff>F</FONT>requency <FONT color=#0000ff>S</FONT>hift <FONT 
      color=#0000ff>K</FONT>eying), meaning it only sends <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>two frequencies</FONT>, above (f+b), and below (f-b) the 
      channel center. This means the modulation hub, 2*b, is about <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>3 kHz</FONT>. Thus the demodulator in the receiver only has 
      to choose between those 2 frequencies. This is a lot less complicated 
      compared to a linear stereo FM transmitter, where the demodulator has an 
      output of many many states,representing the music. <FONT color=#ff0000>So 
      the HF-transmitter is the same for both modulation types : </FONT>where is 
      the difference?</P>
      <H3><A name=Anker144123></A>PPM - Pulse Position Modulation</H3>
      <P>The electronic system in the transmitter scans the positions of the 
      <FONT color=#ff0000>sticks, pots and switches </FONT>and creates eight 
      pulses. Pulse length is related to stick position, e.g: <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>all the way to the left 1 ms, middle 1.5 ms and all the way 
      to the right 2 ms</FONT>. Eight pulses are put together and completed by a 
      very long starting pulse to complete the <FONT color=#ff0000>frame-length 
      of 22.5&nbsp;ms</FONT>. The starting pulse can vary between 22.5 -8*2 = 
      6.5 ms and 22.5-8*1 = 16.5ms, obviously longer than a channel pulse could 
      ever be. The 1-2ms pulses consist of 0.7 -1.7 ms High-Phase and 0.3 ms 
      Low-Phase. The High-Phase corresponds with the f+b transmitter frequency, 
      the Low-Phase with the f-b frequency. The transmitter alternates between 
      f+b and f-b.</P>
      <P>Here you can see the structure of the<FONT color=#0000ff> </FONT><A 
      href="http://www.aerodesign.de/peter/2000/PCM/frame_ppm.gif" 
      target=_blank>PPM-Frame.</A></P>
      <P>Since it is often <FONT color=#ff0000>incorrectly</FONT> maintained, 
      PCM can transmit up to ten times more info into the same bandwith, because 
      it uses 10 bits compared to just one PPM pulse per channel, let us take a 
      look at the highest modulation frequency used by PPM. This 0.3 ms 
      Low-Phase corresponds to a half sinus wave with a frequency of 0.5/0.3 rns 
      = 1.66 kHz. As we will see, this value is exactly the same as with 
      PCM.Otherwise we would not be able to use the same 10 kHz channel spacing, 
      nor the same HF module in the receiver.</P>

      <H3><A name=Anker144351></A>PCM - Pulse Code Modulation</H3>
      <P>About in the middle of the eighties, the arrival of the affordable 
      <FONT color=#ff0000>microprocessor techniques </FONT>finally made it 
      possible to protect the glitch sensitive part of the transmission chain 
      from the pilot to the servo in the model <FONT color=#ff0000>against 
      errors by special encoding</FONT>. Of course this means that transmitter 
      (encoding) and receiver(decoding) both need a processor to complete this 
      task. These microprocessors have become <FONT color=#ff0000>extremely 
      small</FONT>, especially in the receiver (ca. 10 x 10 mm). The simple 
      binary (two state) FSK-transmitter we were already using for PPM is 
      perfectly suited to the task of transmitting 1 and 0 sequences.</P>
      <P>These digital messages are not restricted to just servo positions, but 
      can contain <FONT color=#ff0000>additional information</FONT>, checksums, 
      failsafe values or even an identification of the model that is flown. 
      Obviously one did not want to give up on the accuracy and frame rate of 
      PPM. This was causing <FONT color=#ff0000>bandwith problems </FONT>at 
      first, too many bits needed to be squeezed in the 20-25 ms frame.</P>
      <H3><A name=Anker144697></A>PCM – lots of bits</H3>
      <P>Positions of sticks, switches and pots, originally <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>analog voltages</FONT> taken from a potentiometer or switch, 
      are digitized by an <FONT color=#ff0000>Analog-Digital converter 
      </FONT><FONT color=#000000>to an</FONT> <FONT color=#ff0000>8 to 10 Bits 
      </FONT>(256 to 1024 levels) number vor. For eight to ten servos already 80 
      -100 Bits. Add to this the 16-32 bit checksum per frame, synchronisation 
      sequences and failsafe values , and a <FONT color=#ff0000>bit number of 
      100 -160</FONT> becomes necessary for a complete frame. A bit length of .3 
      ms (JR/Graupner and Futaba/Robbe) then produces a <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>30-48&nbsp;ms</FONT> frame time, considerably longer than 
      the 22.5 ms PPM uses. If even more secure bit lengths and 12 channels are 
      used, this time is increased to 55 ms, e.g. Simprop (System 90), where 
      only 6 channels are proportional and 6 are switch channels.</P>
      <P><B><I><FONT color=#0000ff>So everybody immediately realizes that 
      decreasing the frame time, without data compression , not giving up on 
      accuracy or reducing the number of channels, will not be 
      possible.</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P><FONT color=#000000>It should be said at this time that compression 
      techniques as used by WinZIP, lha oder arj, able to compress large amounts 
      of data in the computer world, </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>cannot be used 
      here</FONT><FONT color=#000000>. These programs look at the complete data 
      set and construct a large (up to 1024 entries) table of "words". That way 
      for instance a 10 byte "word" that occurs several times can be replaced 
      with only 1 byte. With</FONT> PCM, as in any other real-time transmission, 
      <FONT color=#ff0000>the compression algorithm does not know </FONT>what 
      servo positions will occur ,and how often, in the next 3 minutes for 
      instance, eventually replacing them with shorter bit sequences.</P>
      <H3><A name=Anker144934></A>PCM - transmission</H3>
      <P>Actual PCM uses two systems to synchronize the transfer: <FONT 
      color=#ff3333>an extra long starting pulse</FONT> made up of so many "1" 
      or "0" bits , that it can never be mistaken for data, or the so called 
      <FONT color=#ff0000>Half bit pulse</FONT>, e.g. 2,5&nbsp;bits, equally 
      impossibly mistaken for data. Usually this is followed by a <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>synchronisation sequence, setting the receive-clock</FONT>. 
      This is the clock that scans the middle of the bits upon reception. This 
      explains why , at the limits of the transmission range,with PPM (because 
      of the overlaid noise) the servos are buzzing heavily, because the pulse 
      flanks vary (up to+/-30 us), while PCM keeps them quiet, having half a bit 
      (150&nbsp;us) to play with, thus <FONT color=#ff0000>avoiding faulty 
      interpretation of a bit</FONT>.</P>
      <P>Next in line are the <FONT color=#ff0000>servo position data </FONT>, 
      usually in a few blocks, with variable contents. Then we have 
      organisational data, like channel numbers or <FONT color=#ff0000>failsafe 
      modus</FONT> or <FONT color=#ff0000>failsafe values</FONT>. Finally the 
      checksum in the shape of a 16 bit long CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check). It 
      is the rest of the divison of the whole message by a 16<SUP>th</SUP> order 
      polynom. This method is so secure that several hundred years could pass 
      before an error goes unnoticed, while at the same time the calculation in 
      the receiver processor is easily performed. Bit errors can be detected 
      this way, <FONT color=#ff0000>but in no way corrected</FONT>.</P>
      <P><B><I><FONT color=#0000ff>This in turn means that , even if only one 
      single bit error has crept in the ca. 100 -160 bits total frame length, 
      the checksum fails and the whole message is rejected.</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P>The servo's remain in their last correctly received position until the 
      arrival of new, correct data. If this takes too long (0.25-1&nbsp;Sek), 
      <FONT color=#ff0000>failsafe </FONT><FONT color=#000000>is activated in 
      between: depending on the predefined settings a chosen (and defined in the 
      transmitter) failsafe position or the last correctly received 
      position.</FONT></P>
      <P>It is a large disadvantage that a transmission failure of <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>one % </FONT>causes a break in the complete link, but this 
      could only be solved with more complicated and redundant encoding. An 
      audio-CD is a good example: even a 17 bit wide scratch can go unnoticed, 
      but 30 % more data (bits) is needed to make this possible.</P>
      <P>In our RC equipment the <FONT color=#ff0000>redundancy is provided by 
      the high frame rate</FONT>. The servo's cannot process more than 10-15 
      different positions per second. They receive about 45-60 pulses per second 
      however. It is therefore not critical is a servo position has to be 
      repeated because of a glitch. To reduce the failure time anyway, 
      JR/Graupner (S-PCM) and Futaba/Robbe (PCM1024) <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>subdivided </FONT>the frame using separate CRC checks. This 
      allows rejecting only a part of the faulty frame. But let's take a look at 
      how the market leaders have conceived their PCM systems.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <H3><A name=Anker145194></A>PCM - different systems</H3>
      <P><A href="http://www.aerodesign.de/peter/2000/PCM/pcm_systeme.gif" 
      target=_blank><B><FONT color=#0000ff>Structure of most actually used PCM 
      systems</FONT></B></A></P>
      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>JR/Graupner</FONT> actually has 2 PCM systems on 
      the market. <FONT color=#ff0000>Z-PCM (512)</FONT> uses interlacing, e.g. 
      every <FONT color=#ff0000>21,77 ms</FONT> channels 1 or 5, to 2 or 6, 3 or 
      7 and 4 or 8 gesendet, like 50&nbsp;Hz half images on a TV screen that 
      together give a 25&nbsp;Hz full image. This would mean a frame rate of 2 
      complete frames for channel 1, or 43.5 ms. But if the data for channel 5 
      has not changed and the data for channel 1 is new, channel 1 will be sent 
      in stead of channel 5, twice as fast or every 21,77 ms. Information about 
      the channels that are actually transmitted in the received frame is of 
      course also contained in the data. Accuracy is <FONT color=#ff0000>nine 
      bits</FONT>. A bit error means no data for 21.77 ms . Putting the "fast" 
      channels in the 1 to 4 block and the slower ones in the 5-8 block allows 
      optimal use of the command chain.</P>
      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>S-PCM (1024)</FONT> from JR/Graupner is a 
      development of the previous system. To reduce downtime, smaller blocks of 
      <FONT color=#ff0000>10.65&nbsp;ms</FONT> are constructed. Four of these 
      make up a complete <FONT color=#ff0000>44&nbsp;ms</FONT> transmission 
      message, providing data for each servo twice (21.30 ms frame). Accuracy is 
      <FONT color=#ff0000>ten bits</FONT>.</P>
      <P><FONT color=#ff3333>Simprop PCM (System 90)</FONT> uses a direct 
      approach. A frame lasts <FONT color=#ff0000>55&nbsp;ms</FONT> and contains 
      6 data blocks with <FONT color=#ff0000>eight bits </FONT>for every 
      proportional channel and <FONT color=#ff0000>three bits </FONT><FONT 
      color=#000000>for every switch channel</FONT>. Every block, in this case 
      every channel,is secured separately, no need to reject the whole frame in 
      case of errors. The less powerful securisation by a parity bit overlooks 
      "double" errors, but these are exceptional anyway.</P>
      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>Multiplex</FONT> had a PCM System, that is no 
      longer produced. An "improved" PPM called IPD (Intelligent Pulse Decoding)

      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>Robbe Futaba PCM 1024</FONT> uses an interesting 
      solution, yielding the <FONT color=#ff0000>fastest frame rate</FONT>. 
      Differential encoding reduces the number of bits per channel for 2 frames 
      from 20 (2*1°) to 14 (10+4) , reducing the frame rate to <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>14.25 ms</FONT>. In the first frame an absolute value is 
      sent , in the second one only the relative change.A complete transmission 
      message , every channel 2 times, lasts less than 30 ms in this case. A bit 
      error causes a 14.25 ms block to be rejected. Accuracy is <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>ten bits</FONT>.</P>

      <H3><A name=Anker145432></A>PCM and PPM Measurements</H3>
      <P>I have analyzed JR/Graupner Z-PCM and Futaba/Robbe PCM 1024 by means of 
      a <FONT color=#ff0000>Code Analyzer / Memory Digital Scope</FONT>. Both 
      systems are mature and is was not possible to cause them to produce bad 
      servo pulses by bad synchronisation or superimposed noise; thanks to the 
      CRC check of course. Even though lots of bits have to be transmitted 
      without errors , these systems completed the "noise test" (range) with a 
      better result than a very sensitive PPM receiver. Servo pulses on this 
      receiver were almost unrecognizable before the <FONT color=#ff0000>F-149DP 
      (Futaba/Robbe) PCM receiver </FONT>needed to switch to "hold" in order to 
      mask the failures.</P>

      <P></P>
      <P>To record an eventual repeating of the pulse sequence (hold) with PCM, 
      I replaced the control stick in the transmitter by a <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>0.5 Hz ramp generator</FONT>,and registered servo pulse 
      length digitally for PPM und PCM. Actual servo pulse lengths were plotted 
      against the desired values and the differences recorded. The desired value 
      was slowly changed from 1ms to 2 ms and back, within two seconds. Using an 
      extremely weak received signal, PPM pulse length varied around the desired 
      value by about 9 us on average (standard deviation). PCM pulses remained 
      unchanged. <FONT color=#ff3333>Th</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>is proves the 
      general opinion that PCM has better range than PPM to be 
      unfounded.</FONT></P>

      <P>What I consider a flaw in these systems is the <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>missed opportunity of showing the quality of the 
      transmission chain</FONT>, e.g. a blinking LED for every missed frame 
      while performing a "50&nbsp;m-collapsed-antenna-test". This would make it 
      possible to test security of the transmission before and after a 
      flight.</P>
      <P>It would also be very easy, because the microprocessor is there 
      already, to provide a channel selection by means of PLL.</P>
      <P>A "<FONT color=#ff0000>Black Box</FONT>" in the shape of non-volatile 
      memory ( very small, 8 pin EEROM) could continually record the number of 
      glitches and their length together with signal strength. This could be 
      read into a PC or displayed on the transmitter LCD screen on the field or 
      at home. The recorded usage of the pilots channel or even the adjacent 
      channels could also be interesting.</P>

      sector, like the IPD system by Multiplex, Scan-PLL by ACT or Scan2000 by 
      Simprop.</FONT></I></B></P>
      <P>Using a microprocessor in the receiver makes checking RC-pulses a 
      possibility. Failsafe und Hold, exclusive advantages of PCM so far, are 
      now also possible.The accuracy of PCM, especially at the limits of the 
      tranmission range, cannot be equalled by PPM. If the error is small, <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>not even the processor can differentiate between a correct 
      or a false pulse</FONT>. PPM will not be able to replace PCM 
      completely.</P>

      <H3><A name=Anker146262></A>PCM – a plus for helicopters?</H3>
      <P>Not less, but more spectacular crashes? This is a bit shortsighted: 
      <FONT color=#ff0000>used properly, PCM can provide a substantial plus in 
      security</FONT><FONT color=#000000>. A major disadvantage clearly is the 
      fact that all kinds of glitching is masked by the very nature of the PCM 
      system, making it </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>impossible to recognize there 
      is a problem present in the first place</FONT>. So we should at least use 
      the reactions of the receiver to missing or incorrect signals to increase 
      safety.</P>
      <P>The worst case could be the one of an helicopter in stable forward 
      flight , no longer obeying the commands of its pilot, and thus , with full 
      power and perhaps ca. 1.800 to 1.900 RPM, flying <FONT 
      color=#ff0000>towards the highway or a group of people</FONT>. In this 
      case, not at all uncommon, the survival of the heli must be secondary, it 
      is much more important that it comes down as quick as possible, with the 
      lowest possible rotor speed , as this the main danger for humans.</P>
      <P>There is an easy solution for this <FONT color=#ff0000>failsafe 
      situation</FONT>: programming throttle to idle, pitch probably on 1 to 20, 
      should reduce the danger of the uncontrollable heli to a tolerable and 
      reasonable level.Those of us that ever had to experience the incredible 
      force of a rotor on full speed hitting a human being, can understand the 
      kind of damage control in the largest sense the "throttle -to-idle" 
      failsafe programming can provide. The fact that the heli itself will 
      probably not survive this ordeal is totally meaningless, after all it is 
      only a heap of metal, <FONT color=#ff0000>protecting a human from injury 
      or even death is so much more important</FONT>.</P>
      <P><B><I><FONT color=#0000ff>With this simple specification the available 
      properties of the PCM modulation can be optimally used in providing 
      additional damage control.</FONT></I></B></P>

      <P>A comment by the author today:</P>
      <P>I am using PCM (Futaba/Robbe) and PPM equally in my electric gliders, 
      but recommend PCM exclusively for helicopters. More affordable PCM 
      receivers would make me use them for everything.</P>
