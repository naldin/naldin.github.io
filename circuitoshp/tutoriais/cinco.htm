<FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff00ff size=5>T</FONT>he 
555 timer IC was first introduced arround 1971 by the Signetics Corporation as 
the SE555/NE555 and was called "<B>The IC Time Machine</B>" and was also the 
very first and only commercial timer ic available. It provided circuit designers 
and hobby tinkerers with a relatively cheap, stable, and user-friendly 
integrated circuit for both monostable and astable applications. Since this 
device was first made commercially available, a myrad of novel and unique 
circuits have been developed and presented in several trade, professional, and 
hobby publications. The past ten years some manufacturers stopped making these 
timers because of competition or other reasons. Yet other companies, like NTE (a 
subdivision of Philips) picked up where some left 
off.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff00ff size=5>T</FONT>his 
primer is about this fantastic timer which is after 30 years still very popular 
and used in many schematics. Although these days the CMOS version of this IC, 
like the Motorola MC1455, is mostly used, the regular type is still available, 
however there have been many improvements and variations in the circuitry. But 
all types are pin-for-pin plug compatible. Myself, every time I see this 555 
timer used in advanced and high-tech electronic circuits, I'm amazed. It is just 
incredible.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff00ff 
size=5>I</FONT>n this tutorial I will show you what exactly the 555 timer is and 
how to properly use it by itself or in combination with other solid state 
devices without the requirement of an engineering degree. This timer uses a maze 
of transistors, diodes and resistors and for this complex reason I will use a 
more simplified (but accurate) block diagram to explain the internal 
organizations of the 555. So, lets start slowly and build it up from 
there.<BR><BR><IMG alt="Table 1, Manufacturers"

called the 'T' package or the more familiar 8-pin DIP 'V' package. About 
20-years ago the metal-can type was pretty much the standard (SE/NE types). The 
556 timer is a dual 555 version and comes in a 14-pin DIP package, the 558 is a 
quad version with four 555's also in a 14 pin DIP case.<BR><BR><FONT

within 1% of its calculated value, and exhibits negligble (0.1%/V) drift with 
supply voltage. Thus longterm supply variations can be ignored, and the 
temperature variation is only 50ppm/°C (0.005%/°C).</FONT><BR><BR><IMG

align=left> <FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff00ff 
size=4>A</FONT>ll IC timers rely upon an external capacitor to determine the 
off-on time intervals of the output pulses. As you recall from your study of 
basic electronics, it takes a finite period of time for a capacitor (C) to 
charge or discharge through a resistor (R). Those times are clearly defined and 
can be calculated given the values of resistance and capacitance.<BR><FONT 
size=3><FONT color=#ff00ff size=4>T</FONT>he basic RC charging circuit is shown 
in fig. 4. Assume that the capacitor is initially discharged. When the switch is 
closed, the capacitor begins to charge through the resistor. The voltage across 
the capacitor rises from zero up to the value of the applied DC voltage. The 
charge curve for the circuit is shown in fig. 6. The time that it takes for the 
capacitor to charge to 63.7% of the applied voltage is known as the time 
constant (t). That time can be calculated with the simple expression:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#0000ff size=+2><B>t = R X C </B></FONT></CENTER><BR><FONT 
size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff00ff size=4>A</FONT>ssume a 
resistor value of 1 MegaOhm and a capacitor value of 1uF (micro-Farad). The time 
constant in that case is:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#0000ff size=+2><B>t = 1,000,000 X 0.000001 = 1 
second</B></FONT></CENTER><BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT 
color=#ff00ff size=4>A</FONT>ssume further that the applied voltage is 6 volts. 
That means that it will take one time constant for the voltage across the 
capacitor to reach 63.2% of the applied voltage. Therefore, the capacitor 
charges to approximately 3.8 volts in one second.<BR><BR><IMG

Detector'. </I></FONT><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><FONT 
size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff00ff size=4>L</FONT>ooking 
at the curve in fig. 6. you can see that it takes approximately 5 complete time 
constants for the capacitor to charge to amost the applied voltage. It would 
take about 5 seconds for the voltage on the capacitor to rise to approximately 
the full 6-volts.<BR>

color=#0000ff size=5><B><U>Definition of Pin 
Functions:</U></B></FONT><BR><BR>Refer to the internal 555 schematic of Fig. 
4-2<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Pin 1 
(Ground):</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground (or common) pin is the most-negative 
supply potential of the device, which is normally connected to circuit common 
when operated from positive supply voltages.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff 
size=3><B>Pin 2 (Trigger):</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;This pin is the input to the 
lower comparator and is used to set the latch, which in turn causes the output 
to go high. This is the beginning of the timing sequence in monostable 
operation. Triggering is accomplished by taking the pin from above to below a 
voltage level of 1/3 V+ (or, in general, one-half the voltage appearing at pin 
5). The action of the trigger input is level-sensitive, allowing slow 
rate-of-change waveforms, as well as pulses, to be used as trigger 
sources.<BR>One precaution that should be observed with the trigger input signal 
is that it must not remain lower than 1/3 V+ for a period of time <I>longer</I> 
than the timing cycle. If this is allowed to happen, the timer will retrigger 
itself upon termination of the first output pulse. Thus, when the timer is 
driven in the monostable mode with input pulses longer than the desired output 
pulse width, the input trigger should effectively be shortened by 
differentiation.<BR>The minimum-allowable pulse width for triggering is somewhat 
dependent upon pulse level, but in general if it is greater than the 1uS 
(micro-Second), triggering will be reliable.<BR>A second precaution with respect 
to the trigger input concerns storage time in the lower comparator. This portion 
of the circuit can exhibit normal turn-off delays of several microseconds after 
triggering; that is, the latch can still have a trigger input for this period of 
time <I>after</I> the trigger pulse. In practice, this means the minimum 
monostable output pulse width should be in the order of 10uS to prevent possible 
double triggering due to this effect.<BR>The voltage range that can safely be 
applied to the trigger pin is between V+ and ground. A dc current, termed the 
<I>trigger</I> current, must also flow from this terminal into the external 
circuit. This current is typically 500nA (nano-amp) and will define the upper 
limit of resistance allowable from pin 2 to ground. For an astable configuration 
operating at V+ = 5 volts, this resistance is 3 Mega-ohm; it can be greater for 
higher V+ levels.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Pin 3 
(Output):</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;The output of the 555 comes from a high-current 
totem-pole stage made up of transistors Q20 - Q24. Transistors Q21 and Q22 
provide drive for source-type loads, and their Darlington connection provides a 
high-state output voltage about 1.7 volts less than the V+ supply level used. 
Transistor Q24 provides current-sinking capability for low-state loads referred 
to V+ (such as typical TTL inputs). Transistor Q24 has a low saturation voltage, 
which allows it to interface directly, with good noise margin, when driving 
current-sinking logic. Exact output saturation levels vary markedly with supply 
voltage, however, for both high and low states. At a V+ of 5 volts, for 
instance, the low state Vce(sat) is typically 0.25 volts at 5 mA. Operating at 
15 volts, however, it can sink 100mA if an output-low voltage level of 2 volts 
is allowable (power dissipation should be considered in such a case, of course). 
High-state level is typically 3.3 volts at V+ = 5 volts; 13.3 volts at V+ = 15 
volts. Both the rise and fall times of the output waveform are quite fast, 
typical switching times being 100nS.<BR>The state of the output pin will always 
reflect the inverse of the logic state of the latch, and this fact may be seen 
by examining <FONT color=red>Fig. 3.</FONT> Since the latch itself is not 
directly accessible, this relationship may be best explained in terms of 
latch-input trigger conditions. To trigger the output to a high condition, the 
trigger input is momentarily taken from a higher to a lower level. [see "Pin 2 - 
Trigger"]. This causes the latch to be set and the output to go high. Actuation 
of the lower comparator is the only manner in which the output can be placed in 
the high state. The output can be returned to a low state by causing the 
threshold to go from a lower to a higher level [see "Pin 6 - Threshold"], which 
resets the latch. The output can also be made to go low by taking the reset to a 
low state near ground [see "Pin 4 - Reset"].<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff 
size=3><B>Pin 4 (Reset):</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;This pin is also used to reset 
the latch and return the ouput to a low state. The reset voltage threshold level 
is 0.7 volt, and a sink current of 0.1mA from this pin is required to reset the 
device. These levels are relatively independent of operating V+ level; thus the 
reset input is TTL compatible for any supply voltage.<BR>The reset input is an 
overriding function; that is, it will force the output to a low state regardless 
of the state of either of the other inputs. It may thus be used to terminate an 
output pulse prematurely, to gate oscillations from "on" to "off", etc. Delay 
time from reset to output is typically on the order of 0.5 uS, and the minumum 
reset pulse width is 0.5 uS. Neither of these figures is guaranteed, however, 
and <I>may vary</I> from one manufacturer to another. When not used, it is 
recommended that the reset input be tied to V+ to avoid any possibility of false 
resetting.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Pin 5 (Control 
Voltage):</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;This pin allows direct access to the 2/3 V+ 
voltage-divider point, the reference level for the upper comparator. It also 
allows indirect access to the lower comparator, as there is a 2:1 divider (R8 - 
R9) from this point to the lower-comparator reference input, Q13. Use of this 
terminal is the option of the user, but it does allow extreme flexibility by 
permitting modification of the timing period, resetting of the comparator, 
etc.<BR>When the 555 timer is used in a voltage-controlled mode, its 
voltage-controlled operation ranges from about 1 volt less than V+ down to 
within 2 volts of ground (although this is not guaranteed). Voltages can be 
safely applied outside these limits, but they should be confined within the 
limits of V+ and ground for reliability.<BR>In the event the control-voltage pin 
is not used, it is recommended that it be bypassed with a capacitor of about 
0.01uF (10nF) for immunity to noise, since it is a comparator 
input.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Pin 6 
(Threshold):</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pin 6 is one input to the upper comparator 
(the other being pin 5) and is used to reset the latch, which causes the output 
to go low.<BR>Resetting via this terminal is accomplished by taking the terminal 
from below to above a voltage level of 2/3 V+ (the normal voltage on pin 5). The 
action of the threshold pin is level sensitive, allowing slow rate-of-change 
waveforms.<BR>The voltage range that can safely be applied to the threshold pin 
is between V+ and ground. A dc current, termed the <I>threshold</I> current, 
must also flow into this terminal from the external circuit. This current is 
typically 100nA, and will define the upper limit of total resistance allowable 
from pin 6 to V+. For either timing configuration operating at V+ = 5 volts, 
this resistance is 16 Mega-ohm.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Pin 7 
(Discharge):</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;This pin is the open collector of an npn 
transistor (Q14), the emitter of which goes to ground. The conduction state of 
this transistor is identical in timing to that of the output stage. It is "on" 
(low resistance to ground) when the output is low and "off" (high resistance to 
ground) when the output is high.<BR>In both the monostable and astable time 
modes, this transistor switch is used to clamp the appropriate nodes of the 
timing network to ground. Saturation voltage is typically below 100mV 
(milli-Volt) for currents of 5 mA or less, and off-state leakage is about 20nA 
(these parameters are not specified by all manufacturers, however).<BR>Maximum 
collector current is internally limited by design, thereby removing restrictions 
on capacitor size due to peak pulse-current discharge. In certain applications, 
this open collector output can be used as an auxiliary output terminal, with 
current-sinking capability similar to the output (pin 3).<BR><BR><FONT 
color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Pin 8 (V +):</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;The V+ pin (also 
referred to as Vcc) is the positive supply voltage terminal of the 555 timer IC. 
Supply-voltage operating range for the 555 is +4.5 volts (minimum) to +16 volts 
(maximum), and it is specified for operation between +5 volts and + 15 volts. 
The device will operate essentially the same over this range of voltages without 
change in timing period. Actually, the most significant operational difference 
is the output drive capability, which increases for both current and voltage 
range as the supply voltage is increased. Sensitivity of time interval to supply 
voltage change is low, typically 0.1% per volt.<BR><BR><BR><IMG

Modes: The 555 timer has two basic operational modes: one shot and astable. In 
the one-shot mode, the 555 acts like a monostable multivibrator. A monostable is 
said to have a single stable state--that is the off state. Whenever it is 
triggered by an input pulse, the monostable switches to its temporary state. It 
remains in that state for a period of time determined by an RC network. It then 
returns to its stable state. In other words, the monostable circuit generates a 
single pulse of a fixed time duration each time it receives and input trigger 
pulse. Thus the name one-shot. One-shot multivibrators are used for turning some 
circuit or external component on or off for a specific length of time. It is 
also used to generate delays. When multiple one-shots are cascaded, a variety of 
sequential timing pulses can be generated. Those pulses will allow you to time 
and sequence a number of related operations.<BR><BR>The other basic operational 
mode of the 555 is as and astable multivibrator. An astable multivibrator is 
simply and oscillator. The astable multivibrator generates a continuous stream 
of rectangular off-on pulses that switch between two voltage levels. The 
frequency of the pulses and their duty cycle are dependent upon the RC network 
values.<BR><BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff00ff 
size=4>O</FONT>ne-Shot Operation: Fig. 4 shows the basic circuit of the 555 
connected as a monostable multivibrator. An external RC network is connected 
between the supply voltage and ground. The junction of the resistor and 
capacitor is connected to the threshold input which is the input to the upper 
comparator. The internal discharge transistor is also connected to the junction 
of the resistor and the capacitor. An input trigger pulse is applied to the 
trigger input, which is the input to the lower comparator.<BR><BR>With that 
circuit configuration, the control flip-flop is initially reset. Therefore, the 
output voltage is near zero volts. The signal from the control flip-flop causes 
T1 to conduct and act as a short circuit across the external capacitor. For that 
reason, the capacitor cannot charge. During that time, the input to the upper 
comparator is near zero volts causing the comparator output to keep the control 
flip-flop reset.<BR><BR><IMG alt="Fig. 9a, monostable" 
src="cinco/555fig9a.gif" 
align=left><BR><BR><BR><BR><FONT color=#0000ff size=2><I>Notice how the 
monostable continues to output its pulse regardless of the inputs swing back up. 
That is because the output is only triggered by the input pulse, the output 
actually depends on the capacitor 
charge.</I></FONT><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><FONT color=#0000ff 
size=+1><U>Monostable Mode:</U></FONT><BR>The 555 in fig. 9a is shown here in 
it's utmost basic mode of operation; as a triggered monostable. One immediate 
observation is the extreme simplicity of this circuit. Only two components to 
make up a timer, a capacitor and a resistor. And for noise immunity maybe a 
capacitor on pin 5. Due to the internal latching mechanism of the 555, the timer 
will always time-out once triggered, regardless of any subsequent noise (such as 
bounce) on the input trigger (pin 2). This is a great asset in interfacing the 
555 with noisy sources. Just in case you don't know what <I>'bounce'</I> is: 
bounce is a type of fast, short term noise caused by a switch, relay, etc. and 
then picked up by the input pin.<BR>The trigger input is initially high (about 
1/3 of +V). When a negative-going trigger pulse is applied to the trigger input 
(see fig. 9a), the threshold on the lower comparator is exceeded. The lower 
comparator, therefore, sets the flip-flop. That causes T1 to cut off, acting as 
an open circuit. The setting of the flip-flop also causes a positive-going 
output level which is the beginning of the output timing pulse.<BR><BR>The 
capacitor now begins to charge through the external resistor. As soon as the 
charge on the capacitor equal 2/3 of the supply voltage, the upper comparator 
triggers and resets the control flip-flop. That terminates the output pulse 
which switches back to zero. At this time, T1 again conducts thereby discharging 
the capacitor. If a negative-going pulse is applied to the reset input while the 
output pulse is high, it will be terminated immediately as that pulse will reset 
the flip-flop.<BR><BR>Whenever a trigger pulse is applied to the input, the 555 
will generate its single-duration output pulse. Depending upon the values of 
external resistance and capacitance used, the output timing pulse may be 
adjusted from approximately one millisecond to as high as on hundred seconds. 
For time intervals less than approximately 1-millisecond, it is recommended that 
standard logic one-shots designed for narrow pulses be used instead of a 555 
timer. IC timers are normally used where long output pulses are required. In 
this applicaton, the duration of the output pulse in seconds is approximately 
equal to:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#ff00ff size=+2>T = 1.1 x R x C (in 
seconds)</FONT></CENTER><BR>The output pulse width is defined by the above 
formula and with relatively few restrictions, timing components R(t) and C(t) 
can have a wide range of values. There is actually no theoretical upper limit on 
T (output pulse width), only practical ones. The lower limit is 10uS. You may 
consider the range of T to be 10uS to infinity, bounded only by R and C limits. 
Special R(t) and C(t) techniques allow for timing periods of days, weeks, and 
even months if so desired.<BR>However, a reasonable lower limit for R(t) is in 
the order of about 10Kilo ohm, mainly from the standpoint of power economy. 
(Although R(t) can be lower that 10K without harm, there is no need for this 
from the standpoint of achieving a short pulse width.) A practical minimum for 
C(t) is about 95pF; below this the stray effects of capacitance become 
noticeable, limiting accuracy and predictability. Since it is obvious that the 
product of these two minimums yields a T that is less the 10uS, there is much 
flexibility in the selection of R(t) and C(t). Usually C(t) is selected first to 
minimize size (and expense); then R(t) is chosen.<BR><BR>The upper limit for 
R(t) is in the order of about 15 Mega ohm but should be less than this if all 
the accuracy of which the 555 is capacle is to be achieved. The absolute upper 
limit of R(t) is determined by the threshold current plus the discharge leakage 
when the operating voltage is +5 volt. For example, with a threshold plus 
leakage current of 120nA, this gives a maximum value of 14M for R(t) (very 
optimistic value). Also, if the C(t) leakage current is such that the sum of the 
threshold current and the leakage current is in excess of 120 nA the circuit 
will never time-out because the upper threshold voltage will not be reached. 
Therefore, it is good practice to select a value for R(t) so that, with a 
voltage drop of 1/3 V+ across it, the value should be 100 times more, if 
practical.<BR>So, it should be obvious that the real limit to be placed on C(t) 
is its leakage, not it's capacitance value, since larger-value capacitors have 
higher leakages as a fact of life. Low-leakage types, like tantalum or NPO, are 
available and preferred for long timing periods. Sometimes input trigger source 
conditions can exist that will necessitate some type of signal conditioning to 
ensure compatibility with the triggering requirements of the 555. This can be 
achieved by adding another capacitor, one or two resistors and a small signal 
diode to the input to form a pulse differentiator to shorten the input trigger 
pulse to a width less than 10uS (in general, less than T). Their values and 
criterion are not critical; the main one is that the width of the resulting 
differentiated pulse (after C) should be <I>less</I> than the desired output 
pulse for the period of time it is below the 1/3 V+ trigger level.<BR><BR>There 
are several different types of 555 timers. The LM555 from National is the most 
common one these days, in my opinion. The Exar XR-L555 timer is a micropower 
version of the standard 555 offering a direct, pin-for-pin (also called 
plug-compatible) substitute device with an advantage of a lower power operation. 
It is capable of operation of a wider range of possitive supply voltage from as 
low as 2.7volt minimum up to 18 volts maximum. At a supply voltage of +5V, the 
L555 will typically dissipate of about 900 microwatts, making it ideally 
suitable for battery operated circuits. The internal schematic of the L555 is 
very much similar to the standard 555 but with additional features like 'current 
spiking' filtering, lower output drive capability, higher nodal impedances, and 
better noise reduction system.<BR><BR>Intersil's ICM7555 model is a low-power, 
general purpose CMOS design version of the standard 555, also with a direct 
pin-for-pin compatibility with the regular 555. It's advantages are very low 
timing/bias currents, low power-dissipation operation and an even wider voltage 
supply range of as low as 2.0 volts to 18 volts. At 5 volts the 7555 will 
dissipate about 400 microwatts, making it also very suitable for battery 
operation. The internal schematic of the 7555 (not shown) is however totally 
different from the normal 555 version because of the different design process 
with cmos technology. It has much higher input impedances than the standard 
bipolar transistors used. The cmos version removes essentially any timing 
component restraints related to timer bias currents, allowing resistances as 
high as practical to be used.<BR>This very versatile version should be 
considered where a wide range of timing is desired, as well as low power 
operation and low current sync'ing appears to be important in the particular 
design.<BR>A couple years after Intersil, Texas Instruments came on the market 
with another cmos variation called the LINCMOS (LINear CMOS) or Turbo 555. In 
general, different manufacturers for the cmos 555's reduced the current from 
10mA to 100µA while the supply voltage minimum was reduced to about 2 volts, 
making it an ideal type for 3v applications. The cmos version is the choice for 
battery powered circuits. However, the negative side for the cmos 555's is the 
reduced output current, both for sync and source, but this problem can be solved 
by adding a amplifier transistor on the output if so required. For comparison, 
the regular 555 can easily deliver a 200mA output versus 5 to 50mA for the 7555. 
On the workbench the regular 555 reached a limited output frequency of 180Khz 
while the 7555 easily surpassed the 1.1Mhz mark and the TLC555 stopped at about 
2.4Mhz. Components used were 1% Resistors and low-leakage capacitors, supply 
voltage used was 10volt.<BR><BR><IMG alt="Fig. 9b, Astable example"

size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff00ff size=4>A</FONT>stable 
operation: Figure 9b shows the 555 connected as an astable multivibrator. Both 
the trigger and threshold inputs (pins 2 and 6) to the two comparators are 
connected together and to the external capacitor. The capacitor charges toward 
the supply voltage through the two resistors, R1 and R2. The discharge pin (7) 
connected to the internal transistor is connected to the junction of those two 
resistors.<BR><BR>When power is first applied to the circuit, the capacitor will 
be uncharged, therefore, both the trigger and threshold inputs will be near zero 
volts (see Fig. 10). The lower comparator sets the control flip-flop causing the 
output to switch high. That also turns off transistor T1. That allows the 
capacitor to begin charging through R1 and R2. As soon as the charge on the 
capacitor reaches 2/3 of the supply voltage, the upper comparator will trigger 
causing the flip-flop to reset. That causes the output to switch low. Transistor 
T1 also conducts. The effect of T1 conducting causes resistor R2 to be connected 
across the external capacitor. Resistor R2 is effectively connected to ground 
through internal transistor T1. The result of that is that the capacitor now 
begins to discharge through R2.<BR><BR>The only difference between the single 
555, dual 556, and quad 558 (both 14-pin types), is the common power rail. For 
the rest everything remains the same as the single version, 8-pin 
555.<BR><BR><IMG alt="Fig. 10, initial charge-up" 
src="cinco/555fig10.gif" align=right> As soon as the 
voltage across the capacitor reaches 1/3 of the supply voltage, the lower 
comparator is triggered. That again causes the control flip-flop to set and the 
output to go high. Transistor T1 cuts off and again the capacitor begins to 
charge. That cycle continues to repeat with the capacitor alternately charging 
and discharging, as the comparators cause the flip-flop to be repeatedly set and 
reset. The resulting output is a continuous stream of rectangular 
pulses.<BR><BR>The frequency of operation of the astable circuit is dependent 
upon the values of R1, R2, and C. The frequency can be calculated with the 
formula:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#ff00ff size=+2>f = 1/(.693 x C x (R1 + 2 x 
R2))</FONT></CENTER><BR>The Frequency f is in Hz, R1 and R2 are in ohms, and C 
is in farads.<BR>The time duration between pulses is known as the 'period', and 
usually designated with a 't'. The pulse is on for t1 seconds, then off for t2 
seconds. The total period (t) is t1 + t2 (see fig. 10).<BR>That time interval is 
related to the frequency by the familiar relationship:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#ff00ff size=+2>f = 1/t</FONT></CENTER>
<CENTER><FONT size=+2>or</FONT></CENTER>
<CENTER><FONT color=#ff00ff size=+2>t = 1/f</FONT></CENTER><BR>The time 
intervals for the on and off portions of the ouput depend upon the values of R1 
and R2. The ratio of the time duration when the ouput pulse is high to the total 
period is known as the duty-cycle. The duty-cycle can be calculated with the 
formula:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#ff00ff size=+2>D = t1/t = (R1 + R2) / (R1 + 
2R2)</FONT></CENTER><BR>You can calculate t1 and t2 times with the formulas 
below:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#ff00ff size=+2>t1 = .693(R1+R2)C</FONT></CENTER>
<CENTER><FONT color=#ff00ff size=+2>t2 = .693 x R2 x C</FONT></CENTER><BR>The 
555, when connected as shown in Fig. 9b, can produce duty-cycles in the range of 
approximately 55 to 95%. A duty-cycle of 80% means that the ouput pulse is on or 
high for 80% of the total period. The duty-cycle can be adjusted by varying the 
values of R1 and R2.<BR><BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0000ff 
size=5><U>Applications:</U></FONT><BR>There are literally thousands of different 
ways that the 555 can be used in electronic circuits. In almost every case, 
however, the basic circuit is either a one-shot or an astable.<BR>The 
application usually requires a specific pulse time duration, operation 
frequency, and duty-cycle. Additional components may have to be connected to the 
555 to interface the device to external circuits or devices.<BR>In the remainder 
of this experiment, you will build both the one-shot and astable circuits and

   1. On your breadboard, wire the one-shot circuit as shown in figure 11.

   2. Apply power to the circuit.  If you have a standard 5 volt logic supply, 
       use it for convenience.  You may use any voltage between 5 and 15 
       volts with a 555 timer. You can also run the circuit from battery power.  
       A standard 9-volt battery will work perfectly.
       With the power connected, note the status of the LED:
            is it on or off? ________________

   3. Connect a short piece of hook-up wire to the trigger input line on pin 2.
       Momentarily, touch that wire to ground.  Remove it quickly.  That will

   5. When you trigger the one-shot, time the duration of the output pulse with
       a stopwatch or the seconds hand on your watch.  To do that, the instant
       that you trigger the one-shot by touching the wire to ground, immediately 
       start your stopwatch or make note of the seconds hand on your watch.
       Trigger the one-shot and time the ouput pulse.  Write in the approximate
       value of the pulse-duration: ______________________

 15. Using the forumla given in the tutorial, calculate the oscillation frequency
      using R1 as 10 MegOhm, and again with R1 as 1 MegOhm, and again with

<HR noShade>
<FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Review of steps 1 through 20:</B></FONT><BR>The 
circuit you built for those steps was a one-shot multi-vibrator. The circuit is 
similar to that described in the tutorial. The trigger input is held high with a 
10,000 ohm resistor. When you bring pin 2 low, by touching the wire to ground, 
the one-shot is fired. The LED installed at the output of the 555 is used to 
monitor the output pulse. The LED goes on when the one-shot is triggered.<BR>The 
component values selected for the circuit are large, so as to generate a long 
output pulse. That allows you to measure the pulse duration with a stop watch. 
Once the one-shot is triggered, the output LED stays on until the capacitor 
charges to 2/3 of the supply voltage. That triggers the upper comparator and 
causes the internal control flip-flop to reset, turning off the pulse and 
discharging the capacitor. The one-shot will remain in that state until it is 
triggered again.<BR>Timing the pulse should have produced an output duration of 
approximately 7.5 seconds. Calculating the output time interval using the 
formula given previously, you found the pulse duration to be: <BR><BR><FONT 
color=blue size=+2>
<CENTER>t = 1.1 x .68 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> x 10<SUP>7</SUP> = 7.48 seconds 
</CENTER></FONT><BR>You may have notice some difference between the calculated 
and actual measured values. The differences probably result from inaccuracies in 
your timing. Further more, component tolerances may be such that the actual 
values are different from the marked values.<BR>In <B>steps 8 and 9</B> you 
demonstrated the reset function. As you noticed, you could terminate the output 
pulse before the timing cycle is completed by touching pin 4 to ground. That 
instantly resets the flip-flop and shuts off the output pulse.<BR>In <B>step 
10</B>, you measured the output voltage. When off, the output is only a fraction 
of a volt. For all practical purposes it is zero. When triggered, the 555 
generates a 3.5 volt pulse with a 5-volt supply. If you used another value of 
supply voltage, you would probably have discovered that the output during the 
pulse is about 1.5 volt less than the supply voltage.<BR>In <B>step11</B>, you 
lowered the resistor value to 1 Megohm. As you noticed, that greatly shortens 
the output pulse duration. The LED only stayed on for a brief time; so brief in 
fact that you probably couldn't time it accurately. The calculated duration of 
the output pulse is 0.748 seconds.<BR><BR>The circuit you built for <B>steps 12 
- 20</B> was an astable multi-vibrator. The astable circuit is an oscillator 
whose frequency is dependent upon the R1, R2, and C values. In <B>step 13</B>, 
you should have found that the LED flashed off and on slowly.<BR>The oscillation 
frequency is 0.176 Hz. That gives a period of:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#0000ff size=+2>t = 1/f = 1/.176 = 5.66 
seconds</FONT></CENTER><BR>Since R1 is larger than R2, the LED will be <B>on</B> 
for a little over 5 seconds and it will stay <B>off</B> for only 0.5 seconds. 
That translates to a duty-cycle of:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#0000ff size=+2>D = t1/t = 5.18/5.66 = .915 or 
91.5%</FONT></CENTER><BR>In <B>step 14</B>, you replaced the 10 MegOhm resistor 
with a 1 MegOhm resistor making both R1 and R2 equal. The new frequency is 0.706 
Hz, much higher than in <B>step 13</B>. That translates to a period of 1.41 
seconds. Calculating the t1 and t2 times, you see that the LED is on for 0.942 
second and off for 0.467 second. That represents a duty-cycle of:<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT color=#0000ff size=+2>D = 0.942/1.41 = 0.67 or 
67%</FONT></CENTER><BR>In <B>step 17</B>, you made R1 = R2 = 10,000 ohm (10K) 
and C = 0.1uF. That increased the frequency to 480Hz. The result should have 
been a loud tone in the speaker.<BR>If you had used an oscilloscope, you saw the 
output to be a distorted rectangular wave of about 2 volts peak-to-peak. That 
distortion is caused by the speaker load. Removing it makes the waveform nice 
and square and the voltage rises to about 5 volts peak-to-peak. The capacitor 
waveform is a combination of the classical charge and discharge curves given 
earlier.<BR>The time is useful in computer, function generators, clocks, music 
synthesizers, games, flashing lights, printers, scanners and the list goes on 
and on.<BR>

<CENTER><FONT size=3><FONT color=#ff00ff size=+3>Example Circuits: 
</FONT></CENTER><BR>I have placed a couple of 555 circuit examples below for 
your convenience. Play with different component values and use the formulas 
mentioned earlier to calculate your results. Things to remember: For proper 
monostable operation with the 555 timer, the negative-going trigger pulse width 
should be kept short compared tot he desired output pulse width. Values for the 
external timeing resistor and capacitor can either be determined from the 
previous formulas. However, you should stay within the ranges of resistances 
shown earlier to avoid the use of large value electrolytic capacitors, since 
they tend to be leaky. Otherwise, tantalum or mylar types should be used. (For 
noise immunity on most timer circuits I recommend a 0.01uF (10nF) ceramic 
capacitor between pin 5 and ground.) In all circuit diagrams below I used the 
LM555CN timer IC from National, but the NE555 and others should not give you any

which causes the <I>'Green'</I> led to light up. After 10 minutes, set by the

clean up noisy servo signals caused by rf interference by long servo leads. As 
long as R1 equals R2, the 555 will automatically be biased for any supply 
voltage in the 5 to 16 volt range. (Advanced Electronics: It should be noted 
that there is a 180-degree phase shift.) This circuit also lends itself to 
condition 60-Hz sine-wave reference signal taken from a 6.3 volt AC transformer 
before driving a series of binary or divide-by-N counters. The major advantage 
is that, unlike a conventional multivibrator type of squarer which devides the

signal without division.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Fig. 10, Better

conductance Germanium or Schottky type for the diode will minimize the diode 
voltage drops in the transistor and diode. However, the transistor should have a 
high beta so that R2 can be large and still cause the transistor to saturate. 
The transistor can be a TUN (europe), NTE123, 2N3569 and most others.<BR><BR><!-- The following lines contain combination circuits with the 555 -->

</CENTER>The following circuits are examples of how a 555 timer IC assist in 
combination with another <B>I</B>ntegrated <B>C</B>ircuit. Again, don't be 
afraid to experiment. Unless you circumvent the min and max parameters of the 
555, it is very hard to destroy. Just have fun and learn something doing 
it.<BR><BR>

size=+2><B><U>Circuits 11 to 14:</U></B></FONT><BR>Play with different 
indicating devices such as bells, horns, lights, relays, or whatever (if 
possible). Try different types of LDR's. If for any reason you get false 
triggering, connect a ceramic 0.01uF (=10nF) capacitor between pin 5 (555) and 
ground. In all circuit diagrams below I used the LM555CN timer IC from National. 
The 555 timer will work with any voltage between 3.5 and 15volt. A 9-volt 
battery is usually a general choice. Keeping notes is an important aspect of the 
learning process.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Fig. 11, Two-Tones: 
</B></FONT>The purpose of this experiment is to wire two 555 timers together to 
create a 2-note tone. If you wish, you can use the dual 556 timer 
ic.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Fig. 12, Recording Beep: 
</B></FONT>This circuit is used to keep recording of telephone conversations 
legal. As you may know, doing otherwise without consent of the other party is 
illegal. The output of IC1 is fed to the 2nd 555's pin 3 and made audible via C2 
and the speaker. Any 8-ohm speaker will do.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff

circuit. Basically a <B>Yes</B> or <B>No</B> decision maker when you can't make 
up your mind yourself. The 555 is wired as a Astable Oscillator, driving in 
turn, via pin 3, the <A 
href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/circ/7473.gif"><B>7473</B></A> flip-flop. 
When you press S1 it randomly selects the 'Heads' or 'Tails' led. The leds 
flashrate is about 2Khz (kilo-Hertz), which is much faster than your eyes can 
follow, so initially it appears that both leds are 'ON'. As soon as the switch 
is released only one led will be lit.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ff00ff size=3><B>Fig. 
14, Logic Probe: </B></FONT>Provides you with three visible indicators; "Logic 
1" (+, red led), "Logic 0" (-, green led), and "Pulse" (yellow led). Good for 
TTL and CMOS. The yellow or 'pulse' led comes on for approximately 200 mSec to 
indicate a pulse without regards to its width. This feature enables one to 
observe a short-duration pulse that would otherwise not be seen on the logic 1 
and 0 led's. A small switch (subminiature slide or momentary push) across the 
20K resistor can be used to keep this "pulse" led on permanently after a pulse 
occurs.<BR>In operation, for a logic 0 input signal, both the '0' led and the 
pulse led will come 'ON', but the 'pulse' led will go off after 200 mSec. The 
logic levels are detected via resistor R1 (1K), then amplified by T1 (NPN, Si-AF 
Preamplifier/Driver), and selected by the 7400 IC for what they are. Diode D1 is 
a small signal diode to protect the <A 
href="cinco/7400.gif"><B>7400</B></A> and the leds 
from excessive inverse voltages during capacitor discharge.<BR>For a logic '1' 
input, only the logic '1' led (red) will be 'ON'. With the switch closed, the 
circuit will indicate whether a negative-going or positive-going pulse has 
occurred. If the pulse is positive-going, both the '0' and 'pulse' led's will be 
on. If the pulse is negative-going, the '1' and 'pulse' led's will be 
on.<BR><BR><IMG alt="Table 2, variations in manufacturer"

variations in the 555 manufacturing process by two different manufacturers, 
National Semiconductor and Signetics Corporation. Since there are other 
manufacturers then those two I suggest when you build a circuit to stick with 
the particular 555 model they specify in the schematic.<BR>Unless you know what 
you're doing ofcourse...
